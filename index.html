                You are gonna want to be running <b>2x R27ET</b> and <b>4x R73E</b> missiles. With an extra fuel tank for the extended afterburner time.

            <p>
                *If you are running the regular Mig-29 at 12.7 BR you can also run the <b>1x R27ER</b>, <b>1x R27T1</b> and <b>4x R60M</b> missiles.

            <h2>Radar</h2>
            <p>
                The MiG-29 is equipped with a lackluster radar and a lacking RWR system. It is recomended to keep it turned off most of the time when not actively in combat,
                 to avoid detection by powerful RWRs on enemy aircraft. You mainly want to spot enemies visually and use the radar to identify them (if you are not sure if its a friendly due to bad team communication).
                 after locating the enemy you can switch to IRST and lock them up. Since the IRST is a passive system it will not give away your position. launch your R27ET at no longer than 6km range in side / front aspect and 4km in rear aspect (if actively flying away from you).
                 only use the R73E at point blank range or in a dogfight.
