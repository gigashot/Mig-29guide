                Ive highlited the modifications that you should reasearch first.
                <li><b>1.<font color="#008000">GREEN</font> - first priority upgrades</b></li>
                <li><b>2.<font color="#FFCC00">YELLOW</font> - go for theese upgrades after finishing the GREEN modificatins first or if you need them for your own strategy</b></li>
                <li><b>3.<font color="#FF0000">RED</font> - consider leaving theese for last as they offer little to no benefit / use in air sb</b></li>

            <p>
                You are gonna want to be running <b>2x R27ET</b> and <b>4x R73E</b> missiles. With an extra fuel tank for the extended afterburner time.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can BVR with the R27ER, but most engagements will happen on the deck, so the R27ET is the best overall choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                *If you are running the regular Mig-29 at 12.7 BR you can also run the <b>1x R27ER</b>, <b>1x R27T1</b> and <b>4x R60M</b> missiles.
            </p>

        <section id="radar">
            <h2>Radar</h2>
            <p>The MiG-29 is equipped with a useable radar and a lacking RWR system.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to keep it turned off most of the time when not actively in combat, to avoid detection by powerful RWRs on enemy aircraft.</p>
            <p>You mainly want to spot enemies visually and use the radar to identify them (if you are not sure if it's a friendly due to bad team communication).</p>
            <p>After locating the enemy, you can switch to IRST and lock them up. Since the IRST is a passive system, it will not give away your position.</p>
            <p>Launch your R27ET at no longer than 6km range in side/front aspect and 4km in rear aspect (if actively flying away from you).</p>
            <p>Only use the R73E at point blank range or in a dogfight.</p>

        <section id="enemies">
            <h2>Enemies</h2>
            <p>
                What enemies you'll face depends on the current EC bracket you are in.
            </p>
            <p>
                The brackets change every 2 days. So I recommed switching your plane to be at the top of the bracket.
            <img src="assets\EC-brackets.png" alt="EC-brackets" width="100%" height="auto">
            <p>
                Most enemies you'll face are going to beat you in a dogfight, so you want to avoid that at all costs.    
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="strategies">
            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                <b>EL RATTA</b> - The most effective strategy is to fly low and fast, using the terrain to mask your approach sling your missles and escape.
        
            </p>
            <p>
                You can outun most enemies at the deck, so use that to your advantage.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Never dogfight</b>, you will lose.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are in a dogfight, try to go for a one circle fight. (nose to nose)
            </p>
            <p> 
                You can get your nose on target quicker than most enemies. so you can shoot off an R73E and run.
            </p>

        <section id="summary">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                You can be very effective in the Mig-29, but you have to play smarter than your western counterparts.
            </p>
            <p>Also <b>NEVER</b> play the 13.0 to 13.7 bracket, you will get rawdogged</p>
